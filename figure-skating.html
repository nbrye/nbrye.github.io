          <b>Fun Facts:</b> While I am no longer formally junior coaching, you may find me from time to time assisting with the instruction of Skating School classes at the San Diego Ice Arena (when other coaches request a cover). You can also find me at almost every local competition either volunteering or cheering on friends, and I also assist other skaters with choreography and music cutting on occasion. My figure skating goals for the future are to continue figure skating into adulthood, and/or to potentially become an official.
